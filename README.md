### Install all the dependencies
Always install the requirements inside a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Fix dependencies
If you run into issues installing some dependencies, first make sure you installed them inside a virtual environment.
For cython-bbox, try installing it like this:
```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/samson-wang/cython_bbox.git#egg=cython-bbox
```
